# Voice Gender Classifier 🎤

A machine learning project that classifies voice samples as male or female using:

    Custom Naive Bayes (implemented from scratch)

    Bagging Ensemble (with both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression base estimators)

## Key Features

    🧮 From-Scratch Implementation:

        Pure Python Naive Bayes with Gaussian likelihoods (no scikit-learn dependency)

        Handles edge cases (zero variance, array shapes)

    🛠️ Advanced Techniques:

        Custom Bagging Ensemble with resampling

        Supports any base estimator (tested with Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression)

    📊 Performance Metrics:

        Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score comparisons
